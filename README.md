## Problem Statement
 Food waste is a little-known, and even less addressed, problem in many high-income countries.  
 About 30-40% of the US food supply is wasted, according to the USDA (https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs), which not only strains economic resources used to process and transport the food, but also impedes our efforts to develop a sustainable food supply for the future.  At the household level, preventing food waste would also save consumers a lot of money, giving them more disposable income to spend elsewhere.  Some of the waste comes from people forgetting to eat food before it expires, throwing away food that is still edible, or not throwing out expired food, which may spoil newer food.  Consuming spoiled food also increases the risk of foodborne illness.  Especially in community living situations, it is important to keep track of what food is still edible to efficiently conserve food space and maintain a clean, rotten-smell-free common area.
## Description
The users will have their profiles with their name and room number. After adding a fridge to the app, they can add or remove items to the fridge and set a custom expiration date for the item or use a default expiration date. The user can receive notifications reminding them of the food’s expiration date. They can also see an item’s owner and expiration date if the information is not hidden. The user may also delete their profile on the fridge or remove their fridge from the app. The system would hold a database which consists of the users, their room numbers, their items, and the item’s expiration dates.
